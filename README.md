This project builds a machine-learning pipeline to classify breast cancer diagnoses using preprocessing, feature scaling, clustering, and KNN classification. The dataset contains clinical measurements used to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.
The workflow in this notebook includes:

Loading and cleaning the dataset:

Label encoding of diagnosis values
Removing unnecessary columns
Applying Min-Max scaling
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Performing KMeans clustering
Training a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
Evaluating the model predictions

Used Python for this project:

Python programming language
Pandas (data loading & cleaning)
NumPy (numerical operations)
Matplotlib (visualization)
Scikit-learn (LabelEncoder, MinMaxScaler, KMeans, KNN, train-test split)
